- 👋 Hi, I’m @binecon
- 👀 I’m interested in Front-end Web Development & UX/UI
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Next.js, in particular, the static generation of web pages as I'd like to take advantage of the power-saving aspect of CDN.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on endorphins, with sympathetic people <3
- 📫 You can reach me on discord, uname: bine
